# Digital Twin Ad FHE: Personalizing Advertising with FHE Technology

Digital Twin Ad FHE leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology** to create an encrypted "digital twin" of users for targeted advertising and market research. This innovative approach allows advertisers to test and optimize their campaigns without compromising user privacy, ensuring users can maintain control over their data while still benefiting from personalized advertising experiences.

## The Challenge: Intrusive Advertising

In today’s digital landscape, users often face intrusive advertising practices that exploit personal data without their consent. Traditional ad targeting relies on invasive data collection methods, leading to privacy breaches and user frustration. This project addresses the pressing need for a solution that allows advertisers to gauge the appeal of their campaigns while empowering users to keep their information secure and private.

## How FHE Resolves Advertising Issues

Using Zama's open-source libraries, such as **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, or the **zama-fhe SDK**, Digital Twin Ad FHE enables advertisers to conduct ad tests within a fully encrypted environment. This means user preferences and interests can be evaluated without revealing sensitive data:

- **Homomorphic Testing:** Advertisers can test how different ads resonate with a user's encrypted digital twin, all while keeping the actual preferences secure and private.
- **User Empowerment:** Users can directly profit from their data when advertisers interact with their digital twin, thereby gaining agency over their online presence.

FHE’s unique ability to compute on encrypted data eliminates the need for intrusive practices, making a significant impact on the advertising ecosystem.

## Core Features

- **Encrypted User Profiles:** Users can create and manage encrypted representations of their preferences and interests.
- **Ad Testing on Encrypted Data:** Advertisers can test the effectiveness of their ads on encrypted digital twins, ensuring no personal data is exposed.
- **Revenue Generation for Users:** Users can earn from their data without sacrificing their privacy, fundamentally changing the dynamics of digital advertising.
- **Privacy Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface enables users to track engagement and revenue from their digital twin interactions.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama SDK**: Utilized for confidential computing via fully homomorphic encryption.
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment to execute our JavaScript code server-side.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: For smart contract development, testing, and deployment.
- **Solidity**: The programming language used for writing smart contracts.

## Installation Instructions

To get started, you need to set up your development environment.

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed.
2. Install **Hardhat** or **Foundry** based on your preference.
3. Navigate to your project directory.
4. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies, including the Zama FHE libraries:

```bash
npm install
```

> **Important:** Please do not use `git clone` or any other URLs to obtain the project files. Download them via your preferred method.

## Building and Running the Project

After completing the installation, you can build and test the project with the following commands:

1. **Compile the Contracts:**

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

2. **Run Tests:**

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

3. **Deploy the Contracts:**

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

4. **Start the Application:**

```bash
node src/index.js
```

## Example: Testing an Ad with a Digital Twin

Here’s a code snippet showing how to use the ad testing functionality with FHE:

```javascript
const { testAdEffectiveness } = require('./adTesting');

async function main() {
    const userTwin = await createEncryptedDigitalTwin(userPreferences);
    const adResults = await testAdEffectiveness(userTwin, adCampaign);

    console.log('Ad Effectiveness Results:', adResults);
}

main().catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
});
```

In this example, `createEncryptedDigitalTwin` generates a secure representation of the user's preferences, while `testAdEffectiveness` determines how well the ad performs with that encrypted data.
